### About Myself:

Hi! I am Irina. And I really want to become a web development professional.

But after getting my master's degree in metallurgy, I realised that this field of work did not satisfy me. Then I got interested in graphics and worked as a designer (printing), web designer. I am currently continuing my studies in web-design and web-development,  and exploring the possibilities of artificial intelligence in the creation of graphics.
